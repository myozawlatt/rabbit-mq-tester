# RabbitMQ Connectivity Tester via MassTransit

This simple app helps you test the connectivity of your RabbitMQ server using the [MassTransit](https://masstransit-project.com/) messaging framework. It's designed to make sure that your RabbitMQ server is up and running and can communicate properly through MassTransit.

App is built using .NET 8, but you **don't** need to have .NET 8 installed on your machine. Simply download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/myozawlatt/rabbit-mq-tester/releases) page and run it directly.

Enjoy!
